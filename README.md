Code for the Science Hack Day 2018 Project 'The multimedia cyclist' by Nicolai and Johannes

We connected a raspberry pi to two distance sensors and a neopixel led matrix. The setup is created to be used on a bikerack to detect moving objects that come too close (typically cars). If an object approaches to close, an orange arrow is displayed, indicating that the driver should keep more distance.
